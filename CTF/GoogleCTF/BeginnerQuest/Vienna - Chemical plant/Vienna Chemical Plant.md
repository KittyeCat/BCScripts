Vienna Chemical Plant CTF from Google Beginner Quest: https://capturetheflag.withgoogle.com/beginners-quest

Web page contains a javascript script which obfuscates a typed password and compares it to a value in the script. Decoding just requires reversing the obduscation, see ViennaSolution.js for the solve. 

It definitely could have been more pretty, loop with an array etc. I don't know a lot of JS though so I just made it messy!
