Notes for Podman demo via RHEL workshop

NOTE: All commands etc are for RHEL, but should work on other OSs

use your package manager to install the following: podman buildah skopeo

Podman - core tool for managing single node containers (OpenShift is for cluster orchestration etc) equivalent to docker
buildah - core packaging and building tool for new containers. can be accessed through podman but needs to be installed separately
skopeo - for package signing and validation??

basic commands:
-load a container from a dockerhub registry image
container=$(buildah from docker.io/library/httpd:latest)

- "container" is the variable the currently building container is stored in
- "buildah from" is the command to pull an image and build it 
- "docker.io/library/httpd:latest" is the path to the image registry and the ":" denotes which release stream to grab


Now we can run commands against our new container using buildah run:

buildah run $container ls

buildah run $container mkdir -p /usr/local/apache2/htdocs

echo "<html><body><h1>Welcome to my web service</h1></body></html>" | buildah run $container tee /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/index.html


and finally, we can save a new container image based on the changes we made:

buildah commit $container mywebapp


We can also push one of our committed images to a registry, e.g. docker.io:

to connect to the registry:
buildah login docker.io

fill out login details


to push to logged in registry:
buildah push mywebapp:latest kittyecat/podman-demo-webapp:latest

to pull from the registry to create a local container:
podman pull docker.io/kittyecat/podman-demo-webapp:latest

to list all local stored images:
podman images

to list all local containers that are running:
podman ps


and then to run it as a container:
podman run -d --name mywebapp-demo -p 8080:80 docker.io/kittyecat/podman-demo-webapp:latest


can test our app is running by checking the local url:
curl 0.0.0.0:8080



Because podman is not a managed cluster we have to use systemd files to keep the containers running through reboots etc of the host machine. Podman allows us to create the systemd file automatically which is pretty cool!
